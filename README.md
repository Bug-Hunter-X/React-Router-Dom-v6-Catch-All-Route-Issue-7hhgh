This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the catch-all route `/*` in React Router Dom v6.  The problem arises when this route is placed before other, more specific routes.  The catch-all route will intercept all navigation, even to paths that should be matched by other routes.  The solution provided shows how to correctly order routes to resolve this problem.
